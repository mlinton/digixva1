Elektron Style Interface for the XVA1
Hardware integration with the extended XFM2 pcb project - https://github.com/bzeiss/xfm2-pcbs/tree/main/extended

Design goals:
- Performance user interface for the XVA1 synth
- Based on the ESP32 Platform (WROOM32)
- Use UART control interface to XVA1
- Program save/recall/reset functionality
- JLC order friendly (SMD soldered components)
- Plug and play with common hardware (rotary encoders, OLED display, push-buttons)
      - PEC16-4020F-S0024
      - SSD3306 OLED displays
      - SMD RGB function buttons

Features:
- Elektron style detentless pushbutton encoder controls
- Elektron style display for feedback
- Mapping of common performance parameters (e.g. filter, amp, lfo, effects, etc)

Todo:
- Everything
